# Being afraid of other peoples code #

An argument often expressed for the usage of a framework is that people don't want to deal with codebases that has been written from scratch by other people.

This is however a strange mentality, mainly encountered amongst web developers in the PHP community, it's one that exudes a lack of professionalism and experience.

Writing software and dealing with other peoples code is normal, it's part of the daily work of a professional programmer, it's not something to be afraid of.

A professional programmer doesn't look at other peoples code and start whining about how he or she is at the complete mercy of the former programmer, who perhaps is no longer associated with the company or project, and if only the former programmer had used framework A or framework B the day would have been saved.

This is not the mentality of a professional programmer. Nobody does this.

Perhaps the low barrier to entry in PHP web development plays a part in this kind of mentality. Regardless, it is a sign of a person being in the wrong line of work.

A great part of programming deals with people having to work with other peoples code. It's part of the work trying to improve existing codebase and sometimes that involves a complete re-write.

Take note from the great masters of programming, read the book [Coders at work - Reflections on the Craft of Programming](http://codersatwork.com/).

Some of the largest and most successful codebases in world are codebases that has been developed by hundreds of people who have never even met each other, codebases developed without the use of any kind of framework, codebases done entirely in a procedural programming language without the use of anything but the procedural paradigm, and they wouldn't dream of doing it differently.

The [Linux Kernel](https://www.kernel.org/) consist of more than 20 million lines of code all written entirely using procedural programming by more than 14.000 participants without the usage of any kind of framework.

The different [BSD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_Software_Distribution) flavors and most of the [Linux GNU userland](https://www.gnu.org/) has been written entirely using procedural programming without the use of any kind of framework.

The same goes for hundreds of Open Source projects around that world that eventually was abandoned by the original programmer(s) only to be picked up by other skillful programmers. Many of these projects had very little documentation (if any at all), no comments in the codebase, and no guidelines or help to offer at all.

The entire PHP codebase is done in C, a pure procedural programming language, without the use of any kind of framework what so ever.

Whenever you define a class in PHP or whenever you fire up that favorite PHP framework of yours, your running on someones else's pure procedural work!

Sure, there exists such a thing as horrible code, code that perhaps wasn't designed from the onset, or code that perhaps has outgrown itself many times but the client didn't want to deal with a re-write, code that's so bad you cannot make heads or tail of it any longer, but no kind of framework would have prevented this situation. This is often the natural growth process of a program. Eventually any kind of framework would have been torn to pieces anyway.

And sure there exists horrible spagetti code, but nobody produces horrible spagetti code on purpose. Sometimes this is a result of lack of experience, often times it's the clients fault because they change the specifications several times in the middle of development, either way in both cases, even if a framework was used, the result would still be spagetti code, and no matter how much of the object-oriented paradigm was used, the result would still be spagetti code.

As programmers we all try to prevent these situations, but **this is normal**, this is **the art of programming**, this is part of what it means **to be a programmer**!

**The wrong way**: Being afraid of other peoples code. ![Thumbs down](/img/thumbs-down.png)
