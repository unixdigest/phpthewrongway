# FAQ #

It's easy to misunderstand a written document so let's clarify some issues.

**Q:** _What's the point of this site and why the confrontational approach?_

**A:** To create discussion and thought about current practices and extreme views.

**Q:** _Are you saying the object-oriented programming is bad or wrong?_

**A:** No of course not! We're saying always thinking in and always using only the object-oriented paradigm in solving problems is bad. Whenever you think in black and white only, that's wrong.

Even within a single application different problems exist. Multi-paradigm is sometimes the best solution, it all depends on the problem you're trying to solve.

Whenever you force-feed a specific problem to an unfit solution bad things happen.

**Q:** _Are you saying that all frameworks are bad?_

**A:** We're not trying to judge specific frameworks. We're dealing with the issue of always using a framework on top of PHP.

**Q:** _If a framework can get me up and running quickly, why is that so bad?_

If you have analyzed the situation and long term implications and you then see that "getting up and running quickly" is the only problem you ever have to deal with, then it's not bad, but then we're hardly dealing with programming or software development, we're dealing mostly with point-and-click solutions.

Getting up and running quickly isn't designing software, it mostly means you haven't analyzed the problem you're facing and you haven't understood the long term implications of your choice.

**Q:** _Are you saying third party packages are bad?_

**A:** No. We're promoting the use of third party libraries. Code that you can easily integrate into your own projects without enforcing any limitations or restrictions what so ever. Those are great!
