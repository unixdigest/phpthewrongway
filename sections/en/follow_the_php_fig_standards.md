# Follow the PHP-FIG standards #

The FIG stands for "Framework Interoperability Group".

The [PHP-FIG](http://www.php-fig.org/) was created by a number of framework developers at php|tek in 2009. Since then various other members have applied and been voted in, increasing the size of the group from the first 5 to over 20.

A lot of controversy exists regarding the PHP-FIG. Some people consider the PHP-FIG the best thing that has happened to the PHP community since PHP itself while others considers the group as something best to be forgotten.

One of the problems with PHP-FIG is that it presents itself like this in their [FAQ](http://www.php-fig.org/faqs/):

> The idea behind the group is for project representatives to talk about the commonalities between our projects and find ways we can work together. Our main audience is each other, but we’re very aware that the rest of the PHP community is watching. If other folks want to adopt what we’re doing they are welcome to do so, but that is not the aim. Nobody in the group wants to tell you, as a programmer, how to build your application.

However, when we view the work of several members of the group, we can clearly see that the objective is quite contrary to the above statement. These members work tirelessly in an attempt to make PHP-FIG become an accepted "PHP standards group", **which also was the original name of the group**. They do this by classifying the work of the PHP-FIG as "Modern PHP" in their books, on their websites, blog-posts, forums, etc., and by classifying other ways as backwards.

One of the problems with the PHP-FIG is that even though many frameworks and Open Source projects has adopted several of their standards, these standards mainly deal with problems from a "framework perspective", which renders them pretty unusable in many real-life industry situations.

Many people develop software for the industry that has to be extremely efficient, secure, and cost-effective, software that customers are willing to buy and use. They cannot be bothered with standards that has to conform to the needs of framework fanatics. If they tried to be it would be a disaster for business.

If some kind of standards group needs to be created it has to reflect the interests of the entire PHP community, not just framework and Open Source CMS project developers. It has to be represented by the developers of the PHP programming language itself and it has to be represented by a much larger membership with the right to vote.

If you choose to adopt the standards developed by the PHP-FIG, you have to understand that some of these standards - such as the autoloader standards PSR-0 and PSR-4 and several other standards - has a direct effect upon how you code your software.

Many industries demand highly scalable, run-time critical, and cost-effective software that simply cannot be developed using these standards of the PHP-FIG.

**The wrong way**: Following the PHP-FIG beyond the PSR-1 and PSR-2. ![Thumbs down](/img/thumbs-down.png)
